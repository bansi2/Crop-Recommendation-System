🌾 Crop Recommendation System
A machine learning-based web application that recommends the most suitable crop to grow based on environmental and soil parameters.

🚀 Project Overview
This project was developed by Bansikumar, Jenish, and Kishan as part of a final graduate project. The system uses supervised learning algorithms to analyze input data (NPK values, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall) and predict the best crop to cultivate.

🧠 Features
Predicts suitable crops based on:

Nitrogen (N)
Phosphorus (P)
Potassium (K)
Temperature (°C)
Humidity (%)
pH level
Rainfall (mm)

Trained and tested multiple ML models (Random Forest, SVM, KNN, etc.)
Flask web app interface for easy user interaction
Visualizations for data insights and performance metrics

🛠️ Tech Stack
Languages: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Framework: Flask
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code

📊 Machine Learning Models Used
Random Forest Classifier
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree

Random Forest gave the best performance in terms of accuracy and generalization.
